          A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after
              leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur
              in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons
              worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most
              un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.

            Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian
            international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest
            batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously
            captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian
            Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian
            cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket,
            one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals
            (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Kohli has earned praise for his discipline and commitment from
            teammates, opponents, and cricket veterans alike. “He has changed
            the face of cricket and how you prepare for the game. The discipline
            that he has stands out, always,” cricketing great Brian Lara said of
            Kohli after Kohli was named Player of the Tournament for the 2023
            Cricket World Cup. </li><br />
          <li>
            Kohli holds several cricket records, including the most individual
            hundreds in ODI matches and the most runs scored in a single edition
            of an ODI World Cup. He has been named Player of the Tournament at
            global events on three occasions: at the 2014 and 2016 T20I World
            Cups and the 2023 ODI World Cup. Kohli was also a member of the
            Indian sides that won the 2011 ODI World Cup, the 2013 ICC
            (International Cricket Council) Champions Trophy, and the 2024 T20I
            World Cup. He announced his retirement from Twenty20 international
            cricket after India won the 2024 T20I World Cup. Kohli’s
            announcement came after he was declared Player of the Match. Kohli
            is married to popular Bollywood actress and producer Anushka Sharma.</li>
